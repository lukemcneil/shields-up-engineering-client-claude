move the task to done
add changes and commit them, the repo is the client directory
next one

Note: the server and client are running already and the client hot reloads
client at 3000, and server at 8000

TODO:
- make the activate button on the system not change size when a card is hotwired
- show reduce short circuit button by the short circuit bar and make it clear it subtracts 2, only show as active if you have any short circuits
- opponent discard cards is clunky, make this smooth
- make distribute energy page way better and more usable
- system picker should show symbols

NICE TO HAVE, BUT DON'T DO NOW:
- include a live log of everything that has happened in the game as a sidebar that you can open and close on the right side
- use real icons from game, need to ask uncle patrick


DONE:
- make it where I can drag and drop a card to it's system to hotwire it, or drag it to the opponents side to play immediately
- disable activate buttons on systems if you don't have enough energy or actions to activate
- add the icons for effects when resolving effects
- instead of saying Player 2's Turn, say your turn or their turn or something
- use icons where it makes sense, so have energy be a little yellow cube, short circuit a red lightning bolt, overloads a black circle. Still include the number of energy just to make it easy, same for overloads and hot wires. And shields, forgot shields
- make it where hovering over the small cards makes them bigger
