Note: the server and client are running already and the client hot reloads

TODO:
- make it where hovering over the small cards makes them bigger, research how other card games do this online, maybe there's a better way than hover, tell me your plan before you do it
- instead of saying Player 2's Turn, say your turn or their turn or something
- use icons where it makes sense, so have energy be a little yellow cube, short circuit a red lightning bolt, overloads a black circle. Still include the number of energy just to make it easy, same for overloads and hot wires. And shields, forgot shields
- include a live log of everything that has happened in the game as a sidebar that you can open and close on the right side
- add the icons for effects when resolving effects


DONE:
