Note: the server and client are running already and the client hot reloads

TODO:
- make it where hovering over the small cards makes them bigger, research how other card games do this online, maybe there's a better way than hover, tell me your plan before you do it
- include a live log of everything that has happened in the game as a sidebar that you can open and close on the right side
- add the icons for effects when resolving effects
- disable activate buttons on systems if you don't have enough energy to activate. Remember to consider lower energy costs and being able to draw energy from another system
- make the activate button on the system not change size when a card is hotwired, and not when don't have enough actions
- make it where I can drag and drop a card to it's system to hotwire it, or drag it to the opponents side to play immediately
- show reduce short circuit button by the short circuit bar and make it clear it subtracts 2


DONE:
- instead of saying Player 2's Turn, say your turn or their turn or something
- use icons where it makes sense, so have energy be a little yellow cube, short circuit a red lightning bolt, overloads a black circle. Still include the number of energy just to make it easy, same for overloads and hot wires. And shields, forgot shields
